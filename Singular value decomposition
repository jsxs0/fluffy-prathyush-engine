Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a widely applicable tool in linear algebra. Its strength stems
partially from the fact that every matrix A ∈ R
m×n has an SVD (even non-square matrices)! The
decomposition goes as follows:
A = UΣV>
where U ∈ R
m×m and V ∈ R
n×n are orthogonal matrices and Σ ∈ R
m×n is a diagonal matrix with
the singular values of A (denoted σi) on its diagonal.
